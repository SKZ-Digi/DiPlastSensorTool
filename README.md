## Description of the Tool   
The tool offers a guided selection process for quality assurance technologies to be implemented in the production process. Therefore, it offers an intuitive web frontend with a series of selections to define your process and process problem. There is no digital data needed and no data will be stored. After defining the process and problem you may select one of the shown surveillance parameters and a sensor type. The output is a direct link to several manufacturers who can offer an off the shelf solution, but in some cases consultation on the implementation is advised. The tool thus offers a support to monitor production problems that can not be solved by optimizing the machine parameters.   
 
## Short User Manual   
The tool is meant to be used for process troubleshooting in plastics conversion. It supports in narrowing down the problem causes and finding a suitable monitoring strategy.No subscription or login is necessary so you can start instantly. When you reach the tool a preselection of the process and process problem are already made (trying to change that). You can simply follow the selections one by one starting on the top left side with the process. A dropdown shows all available selections. (More alternatives to be added in the future.) While answering what is the process and what is the problem is usually not complicated it can be complicated to define the cause for the problem. Since all the previously made selections stay active you can change any selection at any time during the process, but it may alter the selections that are based on the previous ones if the case is not available (i.e. sagging in injection moulding). After making the selections in the left side area the suitable surveillance parameters are displayed in the upper centre. Clicking on one of the parameters shows suitable sensors, manufacturers for those sensors (direct link) and an advice whether consulting for implementation is necessary.   

The Sensor Selection tool is funded by the Interreg North-West Europe program (Interreg NWE), project Di-Plast - Digital Circular Economy for the Plastics Industry (NWE729, https://www.nweurope.eu/projects/project-search/di-plast-digital-circular-economy-for-the-plastics-industry/).
